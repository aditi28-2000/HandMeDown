A Platform to Buy/Sell Used Books

In this platform users willing to sell their books can set their own price and state the book condition, if any customer intends to buy the book he/she pays the price set by the seller plus an extra website maintenance fee, thus making online purchasing cheaper than the offline one. We would provide general registration and login functionality for users. They can browse through the website , search for their required books and consequently add to cart if they do not wish to purchase immediately otherwise directly order/purchase them. Similarly users who intend to sell their books can upload the details of the books and post online for potential customers to view and purchase. We would add an admin portal to monitor and view all transactions in the system. Using our proposed web application customers can search through a varied range of books and could also interest themselves in certain books they were earlier unaware of. This way through our proposed system we intend to facilitate convenient online trading of books of all types be it academic books, novels or comics and so on.
